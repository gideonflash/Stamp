# Stamp [WIP]

### About

**What is stamp ?**

> "How you get to a solution is equally important as the end result, why not have both"

Stamp is a programming problem solving journalling tool. It allows you to capture, reflect and review your problem solving stages. Here is what stamp offers

1. Capture
   - Capture all stages of your problems solving stages and have them automatically versioned to make seeing progress easier
2. Reflect
   - Use stamps structured reflection template to reflect on how you are going about solving your problem
3. Review
   - Review your stamps using the command line or through a feature rich site generated from your stamps
4. Learn "Future Feature" - scafold a problem based track for learning new languages

**Why use stamp ?**

- Collect how you solve problems in a structured why and have them in one place
- Become a better coder by refecting more about your work by following a proccess that will consistantly help you find better approaches to solving problems
- Make is easier to see how you work through your problems
- Explore new languages and enjoy the proccess

### Getting started

1. Find a problem to solve e.g the 3n Plus 1
2. Run stamp init [problem ] [language]

Stamp should have createe the following directory structure

```
|- problem folder
  | - languge folder
    | - problem.language
```

Okay now its time to tackel the problem. Stamp is only useful if you are activily engaged in your problem solving process, its not about the end goal but rather about making small changes and capturing your reflections at each step "Why is this usefull ?".

4. Make a change towards solving your problem in the file to your programming solution

5. Run stamp [problem] [language]

6. You will be prompted with a reflection template, fill it in and continue

You have now done your first stamp, you can view your stamp by runing stamp view []

Thats it. With stamp it all about making small steps → stamping → reflecting through solving your problem "You could call it show your work taken to the extreme".

### Viewing your stamps

The structured reflections collected when you are problem solving help stamp visualise how you problem solve in meaningfull way, making it a valuable tool to stop your weakness, things you find easy, we call these stamp dimensions. Key features are as follows

- Stamp timelines on problems
- Strengths and weakness profile
- Sharable problem timelines
- Search by language , time, problem and other attributes

You can view you stamps using the options, via the command line or generated static site

1. Generate a static site of you stamps .. Deployment options are also offered
2. Using the command line

### Submitting your work

stamp has a collection of problems , that we can run test on. To test you solution is correct in the command line or on the stamp static site

- Run stamp [probelm] [submit]
- You can find the problem on your stamp view
